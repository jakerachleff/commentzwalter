# commentzwalter

An implementation of both Aho Corasick and Commentz-Walter string matching based on the algorithm laid out in https://cr.yp.to/bib/1975/aho.pdf and  http://www.hs-albsig.de/studium/wirtschaftsinformatik/Documents/commentzwalterextab.pdf

Please note, if you are to run our main.py, please supply your own articles. The current version of main.py will crash since we do not store our article list on github.

The implementations of Aho Corasick, Commentz-Walter are, however, fully functional.
