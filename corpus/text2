LOS ANGELES — For the first time in state history, California faces the very real possibility of a Senate election with no Republican candidate.

Polls continue to show Attorney General Kamala Harris and Rep. Loretta Sanchez — both Democrats — leading the packed 34-candidate primary field. Under the system approved by voters in 2010, only the top two vote-getters in the June 7 primary will appear on the November ballot.

“Never before has there been no Republican on the ballot for U.S. Senate in a California general election,” said Richard Winger, editor of the website Ballot Access News. “There have been a few California elections with no Democrat for U.S. Senate: 1934, 1940 and 1952.”

Such an outcome would represent a new low for the California Republican Party, which has seen its voter registration dwindle to 27 percent. No Republican has won the Senate contest in California since Pete Wilson in 1988.

“It’s a terrible thing for Republicans because they’ll be shut out of the November election, and that will be a big blow to party morale,” said John J. Pitney, politics professor at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, California.

At the same time, an all-Democrat contest isn’t necessarily great news for the Democrats either. In a Senate race that the party was all but guaranteed to have won anyway, a Harris-versus-Sanchez battle means exposing the party’s ideological rifts on the big stage at a time when Democrats are struggling to unite their warring liberal and progressive wings.
